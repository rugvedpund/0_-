# juleska o_ 


- why o_?
- because it makes zxro_ and that conveys how julia completes the final piece of the puzzle also important to a niche golfing community.
- if zxc, do zxc0_ and the logo has x-c blended, forming something like a zÎµr0_
    - ok this is actually a cool name. DONE
    - OR zer0_-

- a global julia REPL for the heaven of a global screenshot-based X window manager with transparent access to the wm, tmux, nvim, vim-mode, etc. layers via a single IPC api. the screen state is always readonly and immutable. any changes to the screen are made by zxr
